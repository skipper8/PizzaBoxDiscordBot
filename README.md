# PizzaBoxDiscordBot
Discord Bot that runs Pizza BoX Game
This Bot creates a virtual Pizza Box of two sizes depending on the number of players. The Game works by each Player taking turns to flip a coin.
The Bot has automaticaly made a circle for each player. If the coin land on their circle then a person must pay the consequence set at the begining of the game by the player.
If a player doesn't land on an existing circle the bot will assist them in creating a new circle and rule. The game continues untill player decides that it is over.
